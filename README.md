# WpfCropableImageControl

A simple WPF Control that crops an image by making use of the WPF renderer (no image processing in background).

- the control takes an Array of images (ImageSources) that will be stacked vertically to form one big image
- you can define areas (from the images) that should be skipped in the rendering process
